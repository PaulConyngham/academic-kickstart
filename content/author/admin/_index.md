Hi iâ€™m Paul.

I believe the ideas of the Machine Learning world are so significant they deserve to be shared beyond the small field of researchers & practitioners that use Ai algorithms on a day to day basis.

Unfortunately, most of these algorithms underlying principles are usually hidden by mathematical notation. Whilst I believe that mathematics is one of the most beautiful languages in existence, I also believe that maths does not help in telling the story of how these graceful machine learning concepts can be of use to you.

The aim of this blog will be to use a fundamentally human tool - stories - to explain & teach these machine learning concepts & principles in order to try & spread these ideas to the masses.

~

As time permits, I would like to share my insights & opinions from the Machine learning world with you,

Looking forward to it & <3 from Sydney, Australia

Paul.
